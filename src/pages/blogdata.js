      <p>Born in 1949 into a middle-class family, Prabhu Goel's story is one of resilience, determination, and a commitment to making a meaningful impact on the world. As an electrical engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Goel's early years laid the foundation for his exceptional journey.</p>
      
      <p>Education, a luxury for many, became a driving force for Goel, who, with five brothers and a sister, understood the challenges of accessing quality education. His pursuit of excellence began at IIT Kanpur, where he not only excelled academically but also became the President's Gold Medalist of his 1970 batch.</p>
      
      <p>The journey across continents took shape when Goel secured admission for a Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon, supported by a father who borrowed money for the airfare. At Carnegie Mellon, Goel found an interdisciplinary environment aligning with his passion for developing software to enhance computer chip manufacturing.</p>
      
      <p>His career took a pivotal turn when, during a summer internship at IBM, he impressed supervisors and earned subsequent internships. Over nine years at IBM's EDA division, Goel developed the groundbreaking Podem algorithm and received numerous accolades, including the IBM Corporate Award for innovation which comes with a hefty $50,000 check.</p>

With a mere $500 in equity, he founded Gateway Design Automation, introducing the industry-standard Verilog-XL.</p>
      
      <p>Gateway's success soared as major players like Raytheon and Texas Instruments purchased product licenses. The company's golden simulator status for Motorola ASIC solidified its global presence. In 1992, Cadence Design Systems acquired Gateway for $72 million, marking a significant milestone in Goel's entrepreneurial journey.</p>
      
      <p>With newfound wealth, Goel pondered his life's purpose. This introspection led to the establishment of the Foundation for Excellence (FFE) in 1994 with a $10 million investment, a testament to his commitment to empower economically underprivileged but exceptionally talented students in India. FFE not only provides scholarships but also imparts employability skills and mentorship. Since its inception, FFE has awarded scholarships worth more than $40 million and has impacted the lives of almost 1,00,000 scholars in the country.</p>
      
      <p>Beyond entrepreneurship, Goel has left an indelible mark in the field of electronic design automation. Prabhu was recognized as the New England Entrepreneur of the Year in 1989 and he also received the 2003 IEEE Industrial Pioneer Award for his groundbreaking work on design modeling and verification through Verilog.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to his professional accomplishments, Goel's philanthropic endeavors extend to education. He established the "Poonam and Prabhu Goel Chair" at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur, focusing on Internet Space. The "Prabhu Goel Research Centre for Computer & Internet Security" reflects his commitment to advancing knowledge and innovation.</p>
      
      <p>As a founding member of TiE, the world's largest organization of entrepreneurs, Goel's influence extends globally. He has also ventured into private equity, contributing to the landscape of technology and innovation, and has served as a Member of the Governing Board of Indian School of Business.</p>
      
      <p>Prabhu Goel's life is a testament to the transformative power of education, innovation, and a compassionate commitment to improving the lives of others.

      <h3>Interview with Saaransh Aggarwal</h3>
      
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Hi Saaransh!! Pleasure to meet you!! How's life?</p>
      
      <p><strong>Saaransh:</strong> Hello!! Life if going great. I have just returned to campus after having an amazing experience as a Graduate Technical Intern at Intel.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Cool!! Could please answer a few of our questions??</p>
      
      <p><strong>Saaransh:</strong> Sure!!</p>
      
      <p><strong>What drew you close to core? Tell us about your role.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Prior to the fourth semester, I was mainly into software and was not into core because till then there wasn't much exposure to core EE courses.</p>
      <p>My interest in core grew in the fourth semester in which we were taught multiple deep EE courses like EE210, ESO203 and EE250. I really enjoyed all of these courses and decided then itself that I will apply for core also.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How did you prepare for this role?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I was preparing simultaneously for software and core. I did resume preparation. I had done a total of 4 projects which included 2 SnT projects,1 Stamatics project and 1 self project, all of which were based on ML. This serves to be very important for any role, because a bad impression is generated when the interviewee is unable to answer a question from a project which is within the scope of the project.</p>
      
      <p>Now, coming to preparation specific to core, I wasn't biased towards any one of Digital or Analog. I liked them both, so I prepared the subject matter of both. For analog, I revised the analog portion of ESC201 and EE210. For digital, I revised the digital portion of ESC201 and a few portions of EE370 which is taught in our 5th semester. I had asked the respective portions which needed to be studied like memory, HDD and SSD etc from my seniors who had taken up core EE roles in the earlier internship drives. I also studied Verilog from articles on the internet.</p>
      
      <p>For revising these courses, I revised from the course slides which were given to us. I had studied these courses well enough during the regular semesters, so it wasn't that difficult for me to recall the subject content in these courses. For questions, I referred to online resources for interview and test questions since assignments were not of the same style as the questions asked in the interviews and tests of companies. If I was not able to understand a topic or encounter a new concept then I would look up a Youtube video about the same. It took me a total of 15 days to revise for core.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What was the selection criteria?</strong></p>
      
      <p>There was a direct interview based on CPI criteria. A total of 6 people were shortlisted for the interview.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What happened on D-Day?</strong></p>
      
      <p>I was feeling a little bit low since I was rejected in a couple of companies in their respective final rounds. When I entered the online meeting, I was nervous. The interviewer was very calm and welcoming. He greeted me and asked me to give my introduction. I became very relaxed and answered the questions he posed to me. He asked me very basic questions in analog (like what is a diode, transistor etc). Then he asked me questions about the projects I did. He asked me to open my Github repository of a project and asked me to explain a few lines of code I wrote. Overall, the interview went very smoothly.</p>
      
      <p><strong>How was the experience there as an intern? What did you work on?</strong></p>
      
      <p>My internship was conducted in the online mode since Covid-19 had not subsided. I had a wonderful experience at my internship. Interestingly, I felt the hierarchy in the company was very flat, in the sense that no one was trying to establish his or her superiority over me on account of seniority in the organization. In fact, everyone was very supportive and helpful. The team in which I was working was developing accelerators for processors. Our processors have reached their maximum limit through the traditional methods that had been adopted earlier. The way ahead is to use ML based accelerators which can enhance the speed of these processors. My role was to make 'test vectors' which are like 'test cases' for the ML algorithms employed in these accelerators.</p>
      
      <p>There used to be a meeting in the morning in which I was told my task for the day. At night, there was another meeting for reviewing all the work that I had done the entire day. Finally, there was a final PPT which I had to present in front of the entire team.</p>

      <p>Ashwini Vaishnaw, the 39th Railway Minister of India has been one of the most notable alumni of our alma mater. He is a gold medallist of JNVU Jodhpur, where he pursued his BTech in Electronics and Communication. After completing his MTech from IIT Kanpur, he became an IAS officer of the Odisha cadre at the age of 24.</p>
      
      <p>During his stint as a civil servant in Odisha, he shot to fame for his work during the Super Cyclone in 1999. Vaishnaw, who served as both the Collector of Balasore and Cuttack, consistently kept a close eye on the US Navy website to stay informed about the cyclone's progress. His regular updates to the Chief Secretary's office played a crucial role in shaping the relief efforts. Additionally, he received recognition for his efforts in developing the Public Private Participation framework for the infrastructure sector.</p>
      
      <p>During his stint in Odisha, Vaishnaw came in touch with Ashok Saikia when the latter was a joint secretary in Vajpayee's PMO. In 2003, he was sent on Central deputation where he joined as a deputy secretary in the Prime Minister's Office in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. His closeness to the late Prime Minister can be gauged by the fact that he continued to be his private secretary even after the former Prime Minister demitted office in 2004. Then he went on to pursue MBA from the reputed Wharton Business School in 2008 after serving as the Chairman of the Mormugao Port Trust in Goa for two years.</p>
      
      <p>Driven by an insatiable curiosity and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, this visionary individual chose to transcend the boundaries of stability and security to immerse themselves in the dynamic tapestry of corporate intricacies. Their decision wasn't merely an abandonment of the past but a purposeful pursuit of a broader perspective, a desire to understand the multifaceted dynamics that shape not only businesses but also the lives of countless individuals. In doing so, he quit the civil service, even though he knew that he wouldn't get the retirement benefits as he hadn't completed twenty years of his service.</p>
      
      <p>He remained in the corporate sector till 2012 during which he led many top corporations by being the Managing Director in GE Transportation and Vice President in Siemens Locomotives before quitting to turn entrepreneur. He set up Three Tee Auto Logistics Private Ltd and Vee Gee Auto Components Private Ltd, both automotive components manufacturing units in Gujarat.</p>
      
      <p>The trust held in Mr. Ashwini Vaibhaw is very much reflected by the fact that in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, his candidature was proposed by the BJP and backed by the Chief Minister of Odisha, Mr. Navin Patnaik. Just two years later, his experience and understanding of the field landed him with the responsibility of holding multiple ministerial positions in the Indian government. Since 2021, he has been serving as the Minister of Railways, Minister of Communications, and Minister of Electronics & Information Technology.</p>
      
      <p>Among his accomplishments as a cabinet minister, he has successfully achieved:</p>
      
      <h4>1. Railways</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>He has worked for the redevelopment and modernization of the railway infrastructure and passenger services. Over 250 stations have been redeveloped or are under redevelopment as of December 2023.</li>
        <li>As of March 2023, over 3,000 km of railway tracks have been upgraded to a higher standard, thus improving the the speed and safety of train operations.</li>
        <li>Constructed several Dedicated Freight Corridors, including the Eastern and Western ones.</li>
        <li>Since Vaishnaw took office, the average punctuality rate for trains has significantly improved and is currently well beyond 90%.</li>
